Last year, for the first time, I have participated in the [Advent of
Code]—an advent calendar with two programming puzzles per day—and I have
now completed all the fifty puzzles.

It was a mostly fun activity, practicing some problem solving that is
not always exercised at work, and refreshing on Computer Science
fundamentals that time faded away.

Sometimes it felt a bit exhausting solving these puzzles, particularly
after a busy day at work. Some of the puzzles were quick to solve but
some of them could be very time consuming (I am looking at you _Day 20_
puzzle!).

As last year I started to learn Rust, I decided to use the Advent of
Code to sharpen my Rustacean skills. As a result, it took me longer to
solve the puzzles than what it would take if I used Python or C++ (damn
you borrow checker!). All this additional time spent in the puzzles due
some level of unfamiliarity with the language contributed to my feeling
of tiredness at the end.

I am glad that I participated though. I learned about new theorems and
algorithms and I became much more acquainted with writing Rust code in a
functional style, in particular using its powerful iterator machinery.
I do intend to keep participating in future editions of Advent of Code.

If you are interested, my solutions are in my GitHub
